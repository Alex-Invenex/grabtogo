### Test 4: Supabase Storage Verification

**Check bucket structure:**
1. Login to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Go to Storage → Buckets
3. Verify 4 buckets exist:
   - ✅ `vendor-documents` (Private)
   - ✅ `vendor-logos` (Public)
   - ✅ `vendor-photos` (Public)
   - ✅ `product-images` (Public)

**Check file uploads:**
1. Click on `vendor-documents` bucket
2. You should see folder structure:
   ```
   {vendorId}/
     ├── gst/
     │   └── {nanoid}.pdf
     ├── pan/
     │   └── {nanoid}.jpg
     ├── business_reg/
     │   └── {nanoid}.pdf
     └── bank_proof/
         └── {nanoid}.pdf
   ```

3. Click on `vendor-logos` bucket:
   ```
   {vendorId}/
     └── logo/
         └── {nanoid}.png
   ```

4. Click on `vendor-photos` bucket:
   ```
   {vendorId}/
     └── photos/
         └── {nanoid}.jpg
   ```

**Check bucket policies:**
1. Go to Storage → Policies
2. For `vendor-documents`, verify RLS policies exist (if you set them up):
   - Allow authenticated uploads
   - Allow admin read access
   - Allow owner read access

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Failed to upload file"
**Check:**
1. Is the Supabase bucket created?
2. Are environment variables set correctly in `.env`?
3. Is the file within size limits?
4. Is the file type allowed?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# Check server logs
npm run dev
# Look for upload errors in console
```

### Issue: "Signed URL generation failed"
**Check:**
1. Is `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set in `.env`?
2. Is the user logged in as admin?
3. Is the bucket name correct?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Test signed URL API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/vendor/signed-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://yyffdrkfimxxieoonksw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/vendor-documents/test/gst/test.pdf"}'
```

### Issue: "Images not loading in admin dashboard"
**Check:**
1. Are public buckets set to "Public" in Supabase?
2. Is the Supabase domain added to `next.config.js`?
3. Are image URLs correct?

**Debug:**
```bash
# Check next.config.js
cat next.config.js | grep supabase

# Should show:
# hostname: 'yyffdrkfimxxieoonksw.supabase.co'
# hostname: '*.supabase.co'
```

### Issue: "Hydration errors in console"
**Note:** Minor hydration warnings about SVG elements are cosmetic and don't affect functionality. They can be ignored or fixed by ensuring server/client SVG rendering matches.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

**Expected upload speeds:**
- Small files (< 1MB): 1-2 seconds
- Medium files (1-5MB): 3-5 seconds

## 🔐 Security Verification

### Test RLS Policies (if configured)

**Test 1: Unauthenticated access to private documents**
```bash
# Try to access private document without auth
curl https://yyffdrkfimxxieoonksw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/vendor-documents/test/gst/test.pdf

# Expected: Access denied or require auth
```

**Test 2: Authenticated admin access**
1. Login as admin in browser
2. View document in admin dashboard
3. **Expected**: Document loads successfully

**Test 3: Signed URL expiry**
1. Generate signed URL
2. Wait 1 hour
3. Try accessing URL
4. **Expected**: URL should expire and return error
