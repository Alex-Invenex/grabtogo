## üîë Getting Your Own Google Maps API Key (Recommended for Production)

For production use, you should obtain your own Google Maps API key. Here's how:

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console

Visit: [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

### Step 2: Create a New Project (or select existing)

1. Click on the project dropdown at the top
2. Click "New Project"
3. Name it (e.g., "GrabtoGo")
4. Click "Create"

### Step 3: Enable Required APIs

You need to enable these Google Maps APIs:

1. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
2. Search for and enable each of these:
   - ‚úÖ **Maps JavaScript API** (for displaying maps)
   - ‚úÖ **Geocoding API** (for address lookup)
   - ‚úÖ **Places API** (for location search)

### Step 4: Create API Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
2. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** ‚Üí **API key**
3. Your API key will be generated
4. **Important**: Restrict your API key immediately (see below)

### Step 5: Restrict Your API Key (CRITICAL for Security)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER deploy an unrestricted API key to production!**

1. Click on your newly created API key
2. Under **API restrictions**:
   - Select "Restrict key"
   - Check only the APIs you enabled:
     - Maps JavaScript API
     - Geocoding API
     - Places API

3. Under **Application restrictions**:
   - For **development**: Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
     - Add: `http://localhost:3000/*`
     - Add: `http://localhost:*`

   - For **production**: Add your domain
     - Add: `https://yourdomain.com/*`
     - Add: `https://*.yourdomain.com/*`

4. Click **Save**

### Step 6: Add to Your .env File

Replace the demo key in your `.env` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### Step 7: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "This page can't load Google Maps correctly"

**Solution**: Your API key is either:
- Not set in `.env` file
- Restricted to wrong domain
- Doesn't have required APIs enabled

**Fix**:
1. Check `.env` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
2. Verify API restrictions in Google Cloud Console
3. Ensure all 3 APIs are enabled (Maps JavaScript, Geocoding, Places)

### Issue 2: Map loads but search doesn't work

**Solution**: Places API not enabled

**Fix**: Enable "Places API" in Google Cloud Console

### Issue 3: Map loads but geocoding (address lookup) fails

**Solution**: Geocoding API not enabled

**Fix**: Enable "Geocoding API" in Google Cloud Console

### Issue 4: API key exposed in browser console

**This is normal and expected!**

The API key is **public** (starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). This is why:
- ‚úÖ API restrictions are critical
- ‚úÖ HTTP referrer restrictions protect you
- ‚úÖ API-specific restrictions limit abuse
